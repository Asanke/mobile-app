- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Electric purple (#BF5FFF) for interactive elements or highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif font for a clean, modern look and excellent readability.
- The 3D canvas should take up the majority of the screen, centered horizontally and vertically.
- Subtle rotation animation of the cube by default to make the scene dynamic.
